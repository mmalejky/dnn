In plain english, we can slightly increase the time required for training our network to save some of our GPU's precious memory.\n","\n","## What is checkpointing?\n","\n","The aim of checkpointing is to save every $n$-th layer's (e.g. every 2-nd layer's) forward result (instead of saving every layer's forward result as in plain backpropagation) and use these checkpoints for recomputing the forward pass of the network upon doing a backward pass. Checkpoint layers are kept in memory after the forward pass, while the remaining activations are recomputed at most once. After being recomputed, the non-checkpoint layers are kept in memory until they are no longer required."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"collapsed":false,"id":"ZiGzzg5qWAtb"},"source":["# What should be done\n","\n","1.
